# MQTT Broker From Scratch (C++)

hi, this is my personal project where im trying to build an MQTT broker **from scratch** in modern C++ ( C++17).

main goal is not just to make “something that works”, but to actually understand:
- how MQTT protocol really works inside (sessions, topics, qos, etc.)
- how sockets, concurrency and networking work in real life
- how to keep the code clean using **Google C++ Style Guide**
